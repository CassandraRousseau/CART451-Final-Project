# CART451 Final Project
## YT

*YT* is a video installation project exploring *YouTube* culture and discovering its visual and audio patterns throughout four categories: Arts & Crafts, Science, Music, and Vlogs & Entertainment. Each category had its video, containing 25 collected videos from various datasets related to their category, resulting in a total of 100 videos displayed in this video series. The viewers confront the overstimulating apophenia of saturated colours, cacophonous audios, and fast-paced *YouTube* content. 

Multiple elements contributed to the realization of the project. *MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas, VS Code, Git LFS, Node.js, Adobe Premiere Pro* and *Tartube* are all the platforms, software, engines and extensions used for *YT*. The datasets used for the project were *Youtube Oldest Videos (2005) Dataset, All PewDiePie Videos, Youtube videos having more than 1 Billion views, Top 14 Ever Most Viewed YouTube Videos, Data of YouTube Videos, TED Talk | Youtube, AI/ML Youtube Videos, ChatGPT â€“ Youtube Data, Mr Beast Youtube Video Statistics, Data Science YouTube channels Video Metadata,* and *YouTube Videos Dataset (~3400 videos)*. All the datasets used for the project come from the open-source platform *Kaggle*.
